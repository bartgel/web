# What

Trying to build out a career build upon my personal strengths and what I value most.

## Feedback

I asked to 30 former colleagues and friends how they precieved me.

- 29 talked about my knowledge of technologies and the capability of easy mastering new concepts 
- 28 mentioned my problem solving solutions
- 25 told me I have helped them and they learned a lot of me
- 24 remembered the funny approach I used to have

Note only 3 mentioned by multi language skills. The reason is that this only plays a roll in the last few years.

## Personal values

After doing some reading and exercises as suggested in [Vivir Notox by  Izanami Martínez](https://www.amazon.es/Vivir-Notox-m%C3%A9todo-resetear-Ficci%C3%B3n-ebook/dp/B083QJBLQM) I got to the following values that are important to me:

- People Oriented: ability to help and coach others.
- Fun: try to make things more fun
- Simple / efficient: I love to make difficult things more simple and efficient
- Learning: I love to learn and share my knowledge
- Movement: I need reasons to do exercise

### What I certainly want to improve in the next year

- Coaching skills
- Spanish

## Manifest

I am going to split this up in two parts. An after work and a professional part.

The after work-part will be an enabler for my professional career see:
