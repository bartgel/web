## Vision

Demonstrate skills by creating a CI/CD pipeline that manages my resume:

At the end a recruter should have a clear and strong idea about who I am and what I can offer to a company. This should also be very consistent no matter where you look.

## Roadmap

### Done

[X] Create a CI/CD stack around my legacy CV  written in Java and FOP.

### TODO

[ ] Use obsidian to manage and create my resume information and write a backport to my old CV

[ ] Create an iconic font

[ ] Create a website to show my CV

[ ] Generate my data on linkedIn


# Remark

This repository is in a POC phase. There is still quite a lot of code-duplication and lack of tests. This will be fixed later on.
